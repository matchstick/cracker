Hey Sarah,

Here is my binary encoded message. I hope you can read it. So as
I explained before, the code you sent me is actually a two layer
code. The first layer of the code is binary. This means it uses
the binary system. To better understand it here is a web link:

After you understand that, the next part is easy. Here is a link to the
ascii table. You want to use the decimal column.

I hope you think this is fun. I like it. If you do. Send me another
message and we will start adding a new layer to our code.

Feel free to ask me questions.

Have fun,

Michael
