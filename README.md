# cracker

## History

A long itme ago I got an email with nothing but the contents of in.txt.
It was from a cousin who I had not talked to in years. I am still not sure
how she got started on this but I was having a ton of fun communicating
with her. Today she is one of my best friends and I am proud to have her
in my life.

This code is really just here to let her know I never got rid of it over
a decade or two later.

## Installation

* Just run *make cracker* to build the cracker.
* To crack her message run *make decrypt*
