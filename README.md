# cracker

## History

A long time ago I got an email with nothing but the contents of the file
binary_msg.bin a stream of ones and zeroes. It was from a cousin who I
had not talked to in years. I am still not sure how she got started on
this but I was having a ton of fun communicating with her. Today she is 
one of my best friends and I am proud to have her in my life.

This code is really just here to let her know I never got rid of it over
a decade or two later.

## Installation

* Just run *make* to build the cracker.
* To crack her message run *make msg*
* To crack my response run *make response*
