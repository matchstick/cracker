# cracker

## History

In 2009 I got an email with nothing but the contents of the file
binary_msg.bin a stream of ones and zeroes. It was sent on a dare
from the sender's high school computer science teacher.

I am still not sure how my cousin got started on this but we had a
ton of fun communicating together. Today she is one of my best
friends and I am proud to have her in my life.

This code is really just here to let her know I never got rid of it over
a decade or two later. And I am happy to be best friends still.

## Installation

* Just run *make* to build the cracker.
* To crack her message run *make msg*
* To crack my response run *make response*
